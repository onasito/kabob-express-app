# ⭐ **Kabob Express App — Full-Stack Restaurant Ordering Platform**

A full-stack mobile ordering system built for a local restaurant, designed to give customers a smooth, modern way to browse the menu, place orders, and track their order status. The platform includes a React Native mobile app (iOS/Android) and a Node.js/Express backend powered by PostgreSQL and Prisma ORM.

This project showcases real-world development skills including API design, database modeling, mobile UI/UX, authentication, secure data handling, and deployment.
